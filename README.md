## How it works?

![Doubt-Nut App Architecture](./docs/PDF-LangChain.jpg)

The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. <ins>PDF Loading</ins>: Doubt-nut reads multiple PDF documents, extracting their text content for further processing. This step prepares the text for analysis to generate responses to user queries.

2. <ins>Text Chunking</ins>: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

3. <ins>Language Model</ins>: The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

4. <ins>Similarity Matching</ins>: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

5. <ins>Response Generation</ins>: The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDFs.

## Use Case Example

A common use case for Doubt-nut is in educational settings, where students have to deal with large volumes of PDF lecture notes, textbooks, or research papers. Instead of tediously searching through these documents for specific information or answers to questions, Doubt-nut streamlines the process by automatically extracting and analyzing text from PDFs. This enables students to quickly and efficiently access relevant information, improving their study efficiency and understanding of the material.
